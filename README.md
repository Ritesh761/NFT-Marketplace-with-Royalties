# NFT Marketplace with Royalties

## Project Description

The NFT Marketplace with Royalties is a comprehensive decentralized application built on Ethereum that enables users to mint, buy, and sell Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) while ensuring creators receive automatic royalty payments on secondary sales. This smart contract combines the functionality of an NFT collection with a fully-featured marketplace, providing a seamless experience for both creators and collectors.

The platform implements the ERC-721 standard for NFTs and includes advanced features such as automatic royalty distribution, secure payment handling, and comprehensive marketplace functionality. Every time an NFT is resold, the original creator automatically receives a predetermined percentage of the sale price, ensuring ongoing compensation for their creative work.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a fair and sustainable ecosystem for digital creators and collectors by building a transparent, secure, and user-friendly NFT marketplace. We aim to bridge the gap between artists and collectors while ensuring that creators are fairly compensated for their work throughout the entire lifecycle of their digital assets.

By implementing automatic royalty distribution and providing a decentralized marketplace, we envision a future where digital creativity is properly valued and creators can build sustainable income streams from their work. Our platform promotes transparency, security, and fairness in the NFT space.
